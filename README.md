# 3D Newtonian Physics Simulator

![](example.png)

Simulates randomly placed 3D spheres and their interactions according to Newtonian physics. This is enough to observe some interesting behaviour, mainly orbits and small "solar systems". Collisions are handled by merging the particles, similar to how planets work.

To run on Linux clone the repo and inside do:

```
./compile_run.sh
```

How to use:

Move with _awsd_, space and shift like in Minecraft creative mode.

Rotate the camera with the mouse or _hjkl_ like in vim.
